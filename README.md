# Physical Exercises
Collecting and personalizing information on how to exercise: sharing tutorials and research resources to show, discuss and verify workouts for avoiding injuries

## Introduction
* There are many different ways to exercise
* Training can be harmful
* Organizations support health - attracting them might make it free of charge (e.g. European Union grants)
* Misinformation - loads of articles, not only about current events (fake news), are published without proper sources, which makes them unreliable: most of them are not true not because someone wants to lie, but because Author really believes in what he is spreading. Confirmation is necessary in order to get proper information and truth.


## To do
* Software
  * As an Amateur I should be able to fill a questionnaire so that software could suggest me training plans fitting my goals, physical condition, time, and available exercise equipment so that I could personalize my workout.
  * As a busy person I want to adjust my workout to my day so that I could easily change my training plan when needed (e.g. I canâ€™t/can go to the gym, so I should have recommendations on what to do)
  * As a human being I want to know how to rest so then I could recover from stress
  * As a person with injury or disability I want to see how can I exercise safely in order to recover or train the rest of the body.
  * As an Athlete, I want to view new exercises, schedule training, monitor progress and share them with my trainer so that I could maximize my progress
